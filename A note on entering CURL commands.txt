A note on entering CURL commands.
We will be using a modified version of the curl command to send commands to Elasticsearch for the next few sections, until we introduce Kibana and its Dev Tools. This will show you the low-level API of Elasticsearch which you might use when connecting to it programmatically from an app of some kind.

Many students like to "type along" with me in the videos in order to help the syntax of the commands sink in. But if you type faster than I do, this can be frustrating. So we're trying something new...

Many of the hands-on videos have been edited to show the entire command I'm about to type before I type it. So while you'll hear me typing it in the background, it's all there for you to type as quickly as you'd like - or to simply study the command in its entirety while I'm typing it in.

This might seem a little strange at first, but we think it will result in a better learning experience for many of you.

When we get to more complex commands later in the course, we'll generally point you to a website where you can simply copy and paste them from to save time.
